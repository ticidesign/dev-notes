# Public Speaking Tips

Conclusion I drew from my observation and workshop in general —
- Get into speaker-audience mindset
- Structure your message and flow
- Embrace your fears
- Use your voice, body language and the stage to bring life to your speech
- Don’t jump ideas during your talk
- Deliberate volume modulation could make a big difference in your stage presence. This is the holy grail of public speaking.

Common Fears —
- Fear of audience judging your knowledge
- Fear of audience judging your confidence
- Fear of embarrassment that will follow into your work

Stage Presence Tips —
- Repeat the topic at the beginning and the end
- Take center stage in the beginning, during the talk and in the end
- Thank the audience for questions if any
- Stay calm and composed while answering questions
- Keep legs straight, don’t lean towards one side
- Hands in front on your body, no folding or hands in pockets or behind your body
- Eye contact with everyone
- Smile like you want to be on stage
- Exhibit energy in speech and body language
- Make the talk about your audience and not about you

Giving life to the talk —
- Volume modulation - be loud enough but don’t shout
- Breathing helps

Nerve management —
- Embrace your nerves
- Deep breathes before getting on stage helps
- Having a concise and clear structural flow of your talk helps with nerve management
- Feel comfortable with the fact that you don’t know everything

You can treat your mouth like a cannon which shoots your voice as an arcing projectile. Your target is the back of the room, and to get there, you need to pitch your chin up slightly, and have a clear passage from your lungs out through a big open mouth.
The really hard part is doing this while also miced up, because it's super tempting to just talk normally into a microphone and expect the speakers to pick up the slack. But speakers are no substitute for your projection and articulation (which come from the raised chin and open mouth).

Speech writing pyramid —
1. Purpose - Educate, inform, entrain and persuade
2. Key takeaways of your talk
3. Structure your talk to flow seamlessly without jumping ideas
4. Content - make it relevant to your audience
5. Slides - You are the presentation not your slides
