# Window Management

Moom makes window management as easy as clicking a mouse button—or using a keyboard shortcut, if you're one of those types of people.

CMD + M  + 'select window'

Another option is Spectacle App, a window control with simple and customizable keyboard shortcuts:

Divvy is an entirely new way of managing your workspace. It allows you to quickly and efficiently “divvy up” your screen into exact portions.

## tmux
The official verbiage describes tmux as a screen multiplexer, similar to GNU Screen. Essentially that means that tmux lets you tile window panes in a command-line environment. This in turn allows you to run, or keep an eye on, multiple programs within one terminal.

@jess notes
We had a session where we shared all our best shortcuts for using computers, and ended up with this list!

*OSX*
- `cmd-shift-5`: screen capture / recording
- licecap: create high quality gifs of the screen
- Window management:
 - Moom: Manage window sizes and positions: $10
 - Spectacle: Manage window sizes and positions: Free
 - Divvy: Manage window sizes and positions: $13.99
 - Magnet: Manage window sizes and positions: $1.49
- HyperSwitch: Show _all_ windows when cmd-tabbing (make sure to change the default from `option-tab` to `cmd-tab`)

*Any tabbed application*
- `ctrl-w`: Close tab
- `ctrl-option-left`: go to previous tab
- `ctrl-option-right`: go to next tab

*Terminals:*
- Oh my zsh plugins
 - autojump
- `ctrl-r` <type>: to cycle through command history with fuzzy search. `ctrl-r` to cycle through all matches of current input
- fzf (+fzf.vim): Even better fuzzy search with previews and stuff
- tmux: cross-platform windowing tool for your terminal
- alacritty: GPU powered minimal terminal emulator

*VSCode*
- `cmd-option-<up>` / `cmd-option-<down>` / `option-click`: multi cursor
- `cmd-k-0` toggle all folds
- `cmd-k-1`: fold all code down
- `cmd-k-2`: Set fold level to "2", and so on... (but wont open folds)
- `cmd-k-j`: open all folds
- `cmd-option-]` / `cmd-option-[`: toggle current fold
- `cmd-]` / `cmd-[`: indent / dedent
- `alt-shift-p`: (when used with VSCode plugin "prettier") will format the code
- `cmd-j`: toggle visibility of bottom panel
- Disable Workbench > Editor > Preview to retain your sanity
- `cmd-p` highlight a file, then `option-enter`: Open file in split pane

*Vim:*
- `wddfwerio<left><left>gnvil45h89#@lsd<enter>fkjweoivdfli<esc><esc><esc>jser8923423`
- `:q!` to quit (edited)
