# Pair Programming

Pair programming is the secret approach to how you grow as an engineer.

## Types of learning 
Harder learning and easier learning. 

### Easier learning spoon feeds

For your first 30, 50, even 100, even 200 hours, this approach is great. But at some point, you will arrive in a plateau in your learning and growning if you follow this spoon fed approach.You're gonna remain a junior developer, an entry level developer. 

### The hard learning

To become an autonomous problem solving mid or senior developer, you need to do the hard learning approach.

Hard learning is doing challenge courses and all the problem sets of it. For example: [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm), [MOOCs](http://mooc.org/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [edX](https://www.edx.org/). 

Hard learning happens when you hit a block or you are struggling or almost giving up. That's when you grow as a problem solver and as a communicator. That moment where you keep pushing through is when you grow. It's when you become an actual engineer.

But most of the time, we do tend to slip into the give up approach when things get hard.

### How to do the hard learning

    EASIER ----------------- HARDER    
                               /\
                              /  \
                             /    \
                            /      \
                        GIVE UP    OR
                                   /|\
                                  / | \
                                 /  |  \
                                /   |   \
                       RESEARCH   PAIR   STACKOVERFLOW
                                PROGRAMING
 


In one end is the researcher. It's when you go deep in reading documentation and researching on the internet. You're doing hard learning but you're not actually doing it.

On the other end, the Stack Overflow approach. It's when you are working on project and you hit a really hard problem to solve. You go and look on StackOverflow and there's a snippet. Cool, someone has had this error before.

How it is the Stack Overflow approach:

    Snippet from Stack Overflow, take snippet, copy and paste. Still not quite working. Take another snippet, copy and paste. Okay, another snippet, copy paste. Okay, they're not working together. Post those three snippets and ask someone how make them work.  You're doing hard learning.

You're doing hard learning but you have no idea how it's working.

Pair programming lands us perfectly in the middle.

It works by pairing two people. While one come up with the approach to solve the problem. The other interpret the pseudocode as sort of a talk through the code. Turning a spoken verbalized problem solving approach into actual code.

Answer these:
— I know what a variable is
— I've created a function before
— I've added a CSS style before
— I have implemented a sort algorithm (bubble, merge etc)
— I can add a method to an object’s prototype
— I understand the event loop in JavaScript
— I understand 'callback functions'
— I've built a project in React or Angular
— I can handle collisions in hash tables
