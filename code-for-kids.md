# Code for kids

[scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)

[Hopscotch](https://www.gethopscotch.com/) It’s probably better than Scratch, but Scratch is free and has a huge community of example apps.

[Code.org](https://www.code.org) - the more creative coding things aren’t as good as hopscotch/scratch in but there’s a whole lot of small code-like games there too. These games can help kids learn about sequences of instructions, repetition and ifs etc. This can be a good place to start if the “Build anything you want!” vibe doesn’t provide enough direction/motivation.

[Code Club Australia](https://www.codeclubau.org/) - you could use the Find A Club tab to see if there's one near you
