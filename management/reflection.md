# Reflection time

Review the past few weeks and think about what to do better in the next few weeks :)

- 15 min alone to write what you've done and think about problem areas
- 20 min (10 each) to work in pairs, talking through problem areas and brainstorm possible solutions
- 10 min alone to write notes, plan the month, decide on an action plan
- 15 min group sharing (tips & tricks, goals, etc)
