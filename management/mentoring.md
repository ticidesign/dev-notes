# Mentoring

What does a mentor do that a manager don’t? More precisely, why would I want a mentor?

- A mentor can help you deal with difficult manager situations (it’s helpful to have someone on the “outside” of the relationship to talk things through)
- In the same light, a mentor might help you prep for a salary negotiation or similar (either with a company or as you’re interviewing)
- Usually a mentor helps think about your career long term - beyond your time at Atlassian. - Some managers do this, but it’s more of a bonus for them
- A manager tends to be more focused on day to day and specific tasks you’re working on. A mentor often has discussions and advice more generally - how do you broadly approach problems or what skills are you looking to improve (beyond “learn about JS promises”) - again, not all managers and mentors, this is general
- Typically you meet with a mentor less frequently (I meet with mine every two months)

A good manager can also act as a mentor, but I always encourage my team to have mentors outside of the team. This helps them gain a different perspective and it can be quite valuable.

A mentor for me is someone I view more like a “life coach” in a sense from a career perspective. A mentor for me, is someone I can go and ask for advice, chew the “fat” and be a good sounding board, seek a different perspective, help identify new ways of approaching business/work, navigate through tough times (that might have something to do with your manager or not).
A manager for me, is my boss (essentially, probably bad word, but for all intensive purposes, they are your first point of contact) for anything work related, I guess are somewhat responsible to help support your career/promotion path etc.
People have different ways of looking at mentors/coaches and managers. Your manager can be your mentor too, depending on your relationship with them. I guess whatever works for you, there is no “norm” to it. 

As manager I can say that it’s extremely hard to mentor someone on your team, because of the  conflict of interest. I usually look for mentors on a different org, and give the same advice to my team, to make sure you have a different perspective from a different context and to minimize the conflict.
