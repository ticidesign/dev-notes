# Git 101

- Everything is a commit in git and every commit points to one or more commits
- Branches don’t exist as separate box of commits as most of us think - branches are just pointers to a single commit in the repo
- Rebase rewrites history but keeps the branch history clean and by pulling in latest from another branch
3-way-merge doesn’t pollute the history but creates double pointed commits that links two branches together
GitHub doesn’t allow 3-way-merge and instead has a “Squash and Merge” option which squashes all commits in feature branch in to base branch as a separate commit
- `git rebase` is a bit different from GitHub rebase - git rebase is fast-forward merge by default. GitHub prevents fast-forward and always creates a new commit hash during “Rebase and Merge”
