# Better Commit Messages with a .gitmessage Template

Here's the antidote: use this commit template (stolen from [@joeferris](https://twitter.com/joeferris)).

```
[one line-summary of changes]

Because:
- [relevant context]
- [why you decided to change things]
- [reason you're doing it now]

This commit:
- [does X]
- [does Y]
- [does Z]
```

I highly recommend reading [this thread](https://twitter.com/r00k/status/1175100703829909505?s=21) about writing commit messages.
