# Nice Girls Still Don't Get The Corner Office
by Dr Lois P Frankel

This book is a list of mistakes that 'nice girls' commit in the workplace. The book starts with a self-assessment test in which you mark how true certain statements are for you. The “133 unconscious mistakes women make that sabotage their careers” and the coaching tips per mistake are divided into seven categories:

1. How you play the game
2. How you act
3. How you think
4. How you brand and market yourself
5. How you sound
6. How you look
7. How you respond

After completing the [self-assessment test](bit.ly/geekinsights) you will immediately notice which categories need most improvement in your case.

In this article I will focus on the mistakes that I was most surprised by as well as the ones that I have personally struggled with or I am still struggling with.

**Mistake #2 - Playing the game safely and withing bounds**

Always taking calculate the risk
'dancing at the edge of your authority'

**Mistake #18 - Not asking questions for fear of sounding stupid**

You are never allow, be brave and ask away. 
The answer can benefit many other in the room.
But be sensitive with the other in the room, don't ask many questions.

**Mistake #61 - Failing to define your brand**

What makes you unique?
Communicate your values and mission



“When someone compliments you,” writes Frankel, “don’t say, ‘Oh, it was nothing’, say a simple thank you.”  And, never apologize unnecessarily. She advises women to surround themselves with “Plexiglas shields”; in other words, thick skins which jealous sniping cannot penetrate. Which again has to do something with "being nice" understood in the wrong way. As the nice girl should be "shy" a bit and "humble".

**Mistake #54 - Don’t dare to negotiate**

Explanation: Women underestimate their value and are less likely to negotiate. Whereas, men often overestimate their value and appear more confident in the process of negotiating.

Coaching tips: First of all, make sure you deliver excellent results. This gives you a stronger position in the negotiation process. Do your homework and find out what others in the company or in a similar position earn. By doing this you will find out what is realistic to ask for. Be clear about what you want. Have a plan B and come up with alternatives in case you are not able to reach an agreement. What do you find reasonable to compromise with? Prepare for resistance and come up with arguments on how to act when your opponent rejects your request.

**Mistake #66 - Waiting to Be Noticed**

Explanation: If you wait until you get noticed, you will not make much progress in your career. Promotions are often given to men because women are naive and expect to be noticed for their skills and capabilities.

Coaching tips: If you want to get a certain project or promotion, you need to ask for it. If you want to make a career step, talk about it. Let others know what your ambitions are. Know your own value and learn how.

**Mistake #118. Believing Others Know More than You**

Explanation: Women are more likely to underestimate their own knowledge and abilities and even assume that complete strangers are more capable or knowledgeable than themselves. Men are easily able to sell us bullshit stories and are very persuasive while doing it. The worst of all is that we actually believe them.

Coaching tips: Before you assume that someone else knows more than you do, ask your opponent a few critical questions: “How do you know that?”, “Why would you advise this course of action?” If the answers don’t sound reliable to you then they are most probably not. Take the time to think about the advice/opinion of others and don’t let people sell you anything just because they come across as persuasive.
