# Intreview Questions

Here are some of the most common interview questions, along with the best way to answer them:

1. Tell me about yourself.
This is one of the first questions you are likely to be asked. Be prepared to talk about yourself, and why you're an excellent fit for the job. Try to answer questions about yourself without giving out too much, or too little, personal information. You can start by sharing some of your personal interests and experiences that don't relate directly to work, such as a favourite hobby or a brief account of where you grew up, your education, and what motivates you. 

2. Why should we hire you?
Be prepared to say why you're the applicant who should be hired. This is not the time to be modest (although neither should you be conceited). Make your response a confident, concise, focused sales pitch that explains what you have to offer the employer, and why you should get the job. 

3. What is your greatest strength? Best skills?
When you are asked about your greatest strengths, it's important to discuss the attributes that will qualify you for the specific job and set you apart from the other candidates. Take the time before the job interview to make matches between your qualifications and the requirements as stated in the job announcement. 

4. What is your greatest weakness?
Do your best to frame your answers around positive aspects of your skills and abilities as an employee, turning seeming “weaknesses” into strengths. For example, you might say something like, “I’ve always struggled with perfectionism – I truly want to do the job correctly the first time, but this sometimes means that I devote more time to a project than is necessary. 

5. Why are you leaving or why have you left your job? Why are you chance your job?
When asked about why you are moving on from your current position, stick with the facts, be direct, and focus your interview answer on the future, especially if your leaving wasn't under the best of circumstances.. In addition, it’s important to avoid bashing your current organization, colleagues or supervisor. An employer is not likely to want to bring on someone who talks negatively about a company.

6. What are your salary expectations?
What are you looking for in terms of salary? It seems like a simple question, but your answer can knock you out of the contest for the job if you overprice yourself. If you under-price yourself, you may get short-changed with a lower offer. 

7. Why do you want this job?
This question gives you an opportunity to show the interviewer what you know about the job and the company, so take the time before the interview to thoroughly research the company and its products or services, company culture, and mission. Be specific about what makes you a good fit for this role, and mention aspects of the company and position that appeal to you the most.

8. How do you handle stress and pressure? How do you see stress and pressure? 
The best way to respond to this question is to give an example of how you have successfully handled stress in a previous job.

9. Describe a difficult work situation or project and how you overcame it. 
Be prepared to share an example of what you did in a tough situation. It’s important to share details around this example in order to make the story believable and engaging. Those being said, avoid talking negatively, or extensively, about other people. This can detract from what the interviewer really wants to know about, which is how you can successfully perform in a challenging situation.

10. What are your goals for the future? 
This question is designed to find out if you’re going to stick around or move on as soon as you find a better opportunity. Keep your answer focused on the job and the company you’re interviewing with, and reiterate to the interviewer that the position aligns with your long-term goals.
