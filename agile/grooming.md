# Backlog and Sprint grooming

Created by Dale Hurwitz

## Why groom?

Grooming is important for general health and wellbeing and to stay lice-free. Our issues and sprints are no exception.

We often create issues, assign them to our sprints, and don’t think much about them until we come across them in sprint planning. Grooming provides the team an opportunity to do issue maintenance up front, so that when it comes time to plan our sprints we can spend more time aligning on priorities and goals and less time asking “what’s this?”.

Grooming could also help improve our issue and PR cycle time by promoting units of work that are better defined and with clearer borders.

## How do we groom?

There is no strict process around grooming, but some common grooming chores include:

- Estimations - This is a good opportunity to give your issues estimates. Where necessary, you can organise an estimation session with team mates. Aim to keep it quick and lean.

- Information gathering - Updating issues to ensure all requirements are listed and clear, and all necessary context provided.

- Issue breakdown - Is a task you’re working on or an upcoming task larger or more complicated than anticipated? There could be an opportunity to:

  - Split issues into several new issues (best not to use sub-tasks). Each issue should have an associated PR.

  - Turn an issue into an epic with child issues

- Prioritising - If you’re the reporter of issue(s), have several issues assigned to you, or are a feature lead, this could be an opportunity to re-rank issues or move them in or out of upcoming sprints. Always use team priorities and goals as your guiding light, and consider dev capacity. When in doubt, discuss priorities in sprint planning.

- Cleanup - For those issues that have been sitting in the backlog rusting away:

  - Delete, move or reassign old or redundant issues

  - Move issues into relevant epics for greater visibility

## When do we groom?

Grooming can happen at any point during a sprint, and can usually be conducted individually and asynchronously.

A 30-minute slot prior to sprint planning has been placed in your calendar as a reminder. Perhaps a weekly reminder would be even better?
