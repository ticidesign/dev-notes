## Review

Google attracts, motivates and retains some of the world’s top talent. Once it hires these stars, they usually thrive. Google’s head of “People Operations,” Laszlo Bock, explains nine rules Google uses that you can follow to transform your organization in its model from a company that controls employees to one that sets them free to innovate, make improvements and inspire one another. If you’ve read about or researched Google’s management methods, you already know most of the methods here for motivating and retaining employees. But if you’re new to the Google way, this will provide good background knowledge. To say the least, Bock is a company man. Google can do no wrong by him. He presents its nine rules as a kind of gospel, and he doesn’t address any internal contradictions, or any contradictions at all between Google’s rules and its actions. Of course, no workplace anywhere is as wonderful as Bock paints Google to be, but you can’t argue with its success. Bock asserts that Google’s philosophy stems from founders Sergey Brin’s and Larry Page’s decision to make talent their first priority. To retain the people it hires, Google provides stock ownership, benefits, freedom, autonomy and inclusion. By describing Google’s singular, rational and absurdly effective HR approach in detail – and by telling you how it fits together – Bock offers a valuable tool for leaders at every level in all industries. getAbstract recommends Google’s rules of engagement to HR managers, entrepreneurs, owners of small businesses and executives of all kinds.

## Nine Rules

Bock carefully outlines the nine personnel rules Google follows. He reports that the company’s leaders attribute most of its success to these nine axioms:

1. “Give your work meaning” – Google’s culture pursues “mission, transparency and voice.” It believes employees who love their work lead happier, healthier lives. It gives people the freedom to be their best, knowing they will act like founders, not employees and, as a result, they’ll preserve and enhance Google’s culture. Bock shares its higher purpose by including stories about how staffers have helped people and how Google arranges them to meet consumers they benefit.

2. “Trust your people” – Google values information transparency. Bock says it trustingly gives new employees access to its “code base” and proprietary algorithms on their first day. Sharing information helps Google coordinate projects and reduce redundancy. The company encourages employees’ ideas, complaints and suggestions. Leaders deliberately give staff members more freedom and autonomy than they – the leaders – feel comfortable giving. Page and Brin believe that if managers aren’t nervous, they haven’t granted their employees sufficient autonomy.

3. “Hire only people who are better than you” – Bock asserts that Google’s most critical personnel function is hiring, and that’s where it spends the majority of its HR budget. This is his bailiwick, and you can appreciate his inside perspective in this discussion. Google hires one-quarter of 1% of its millions of applicants. In contrast, Harvard University takes in a little more than 6%. If you want to work at Google, then head for State U. since Google prefers to hire exceptional state college graduates above grads from good or even top Ivy League schools. Its priority is exceptional past performance and cultural fit. Bock knows the best candidates don’t apply; they’re already busy in jobs they like. Google finds and tracks top talent using common tools like LinkedIn. Don’t get spooked, but it follows people for months or even years, building relationships and deepening its potential talent pools. When hiring, Google tests candidates for intelligence, leadership and “conscientiousness.” The process, Bock says, is designed to eliminate bias; candidates interview with four different managers who ask the same or similar job-related, situational questions. Google doesn’t let managers pick new hires for their teams, fire people, or bestow raises and promotions. As Bock clarifies, these limits strip managers of coercive power.

4. “Don’t confuse development with managing performance” – Google’s managers work with their employees to create clear, measurable and aggressive goals. Bock looks inside performance reviews, where managers propose a rating based on each employee’s personal progress in meeting planned goals. A committee of managers looks at all the employees in the group and makes the final “calibration.” Employees nominate themselves for promotions, and a committee decides who moves up. Google offers training courses in specific skills and knowledge. However, as Bock makes clear, it doesn’t provide classes in a vacuum. Instead, it tracks the outcomes of its training efforts. Google employees with expertise instruct other staffers. Google maintains a stable of experts for one-on-one coaching in career planning, leadership and sales.

5. “Focus on the two tails” – Google focuses on its bottom 5% and top 5% of performers. Leaders work to move lower performers up to average performance. Bock says Google learns what drives superior performance by studying its best workers, and uses its findings to assist low performers and hire better people. Employees also rate managers, who – though it doesn’t sound like much fun – meet with their teams after seeing their evaluations to discuss how to improve.

6. “Be frugal and generous” – Bock catalogs Google’s benefits, including free food, free shuttles, time off to dabble, electric cars for employees to borrow and on-site subsidized day care. Low-cost benefits include Employee Resource Groups, tech talks, on-site haircuts, dry cleaning and massage chairs. Bock says the company’s calculus is that Google reaps returns – in staff goodwill, loyalty and retention – that neutralize the cost of benefits such as fully paid maternity leave and spousal death benefits. Perks encourage serendipitous encounters among people who wouldn’t otherwise connect. Bock reports that Google encourages employees to form groups around various topics, work-related or not, and to invite speakers – many famous – to lead discussions on subjects from yoga to Game of Thrones.

7. “Pay unfairly” – Before its IPO in 2004, Google paid most people below market rates. Bock explains that it distributed stock options – and still does – to all Google employees, offering a significant payout, even wealth. After its IPO, Google raised its base pay and set up cash and stock incentive programs, such as its “Founders Award,” to mimic a start-up’s atmosphere of potential gains. Google employees sometimes request cash and stock, but, Bock notes, these awards have only a small impact on motivation and happiness. Experience-related perks are the most popular benefits. Bock acknowledges that two people at the same level can have a tenfold pay difference. Google rewards performance and results; on average, top talents earn two or three times more than low performers.

8. “Nudge” – Google uses subtle cues, tips, checklists and suggestions (or as Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein called them, “nudges”) to encourage people to make healthier, more effective choices. For example, Bock says, rather than ban unhealthy food options in its cafés, Google moved such items to the periphery, putting healthy choices and small plates at eye level in convenient places. To increase the impact of its onboarding program, Google sends detailed emails to managers about new hires, called “Nooglers.” The emails include best-practice checklists about how to engage and support new people from day one. Nooglers get a similar checklist with actions to take to accelerate acclimation. But, Bock explains, before Google makes changes, it tests them in small groups.

9. “Manage the Rising Expectations” – Google’s leaders encourage staffers to pursue their own ideas. Consequently, Bock explains, it has closed some programs, some after years of effort and significant cost. Recently, it curtailed the number of projects staffers can work on simultaneously.

Bock covers the concern that Google may create a sense of entitlement by offering generous life and work benefits. Spoiled Google employees might even revolt when management takes something away. For example, he relates, when it changed the menus in two cafés to observe “Meatless Mondays,” some employees threw food at the chefs and posted threatening chats. Rather than fire these employees, Google shares anonymous details of their tantrums with their co-workers. Bock is proud that Google consistently puts principles above profits. To protect its values of trust and transparency, it immediately fires anyone who leaks privileged information for any reason, even by accident. So, if you wonder if Bock’s book tells any tales out of school, that should answer your question.

# My highlights

1. **Be experiments** - Data Driven approach
2. When it comes to hiring, the **crowd is smarter than any individual**
3. Perks don't have to be costly
4. Focus on **the worst and the best** (Comparing the extremes)
5. Compassionate Pragmatism

**Culture eats strategy for breakfast**

If you give people freedom they will amaze you. A group's culture can be studies in three ways:

1.  By looking at the artifacts such as physical spaces and behavoirs.
2.  By surveying the beliefs and values espoused by groups members.
3.  By digging deeper into the underlying assumptions behind those values.

**Searching for the best**

The evolutions of Google's self-replicating talent machine: 1-3 million people apply to Google each year, they hire about 5,000 per year. 1/4% of a percent roughly. Compared to 6% acceptance for Harvard applicants.

They say hire smart generalists rather than experts. People that are clever and curious, not experts. People that can solve today's prolems and unknown problems that come up in the future.

Google analysis revealed academic performance did not predict job performance.

Work rules for finding exceptional candidates:

1. Get the best referrals by being excruciatingly specific in describing what you are looking for.
2. Make recruiting part of everyone's job.
3. Don't be afraid to try crazy things to get the attention of the best people.

**The two tails**

Work rules for managing your two tails (best and worst employees):

1. Help those in need.
2. Put your best people under the microscope.
3. Use surveys and checklist to find the truth and nudge people to improve.
4. Set a personal example by sharing and acting on your own feedback.
