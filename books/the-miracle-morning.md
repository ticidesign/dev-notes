**Recommendation**

Life coach Hal Elrod likes to talk – so much so that he allows the retelling of his near-death experience to overshadow his central thesis: his “miracle morning.” But patient viewers willing to dig deep will garner useful tidbits for life. According to Elrod, individuals who are productive in the mornings each day will attain their goals. He describes his personal journey from adversity to success and the lessons he learned en route. Though Elrod’s tendency toward repetition adds fluff to his delivery, his core message will inspire those who strive to transform their lives.

**Take-Aways**

- A devastating car accident led life coach Hal Elrod to develop several coping mechanisms. He learned to accept situations he had no power to change.
- Elrod follows a “five-minute rule” whereby he allows himself to feel five minutes of negative emotion before refocusing on gratitude.
- Elrod discovered that a morning ritual is the most essential element to living the life of your dreams.
- He incorporates six powerful practices in his “miracle morning” routine: “meditation, affirmations, visualization, exercise, reading and journaling.”
- To change a habit, stick with it for 30 days. The first 10 days are “unbearable.” The second 10 days are “uncomfortable.” By the final 10 days, you’ll feel “unstoppable.”

**Summary**

To live the life of your dreams, you need to “win the day” every day. The best way to achieve this is to have a fruitful morning routine. Hal Elrod learned this lesson the hard way. In 1999, Elrod was involved in a devastating car accident. His doctors weren’t sure he’d ever walk again. But the news didn’t phase Elrod, who lived his life by the [“five-minute rule”](https://youtu.be/U0uRp7BoPVY?t=1712) – that is, he permitted himself to harbor negative emotions for just five minutes. But as he couldn’t change the situation, he refused to wallow in self-pity. He chose instead to focus on the positive and be grateful for what he had. Elrod learned “the ABCs of taking life head-on.” A stands for “accept all things you can’t change.” B stands for “be grateful for everything.” All people experience positivity and negativity in their lives. Many people believe that zeroing in on the negative is a more “realistic” frame of mind, but focusing on the positive is just as realistic. C stands for “create daily progress towards becoming the person you need to be to create your vision.”

    “If you want to achieve your full potential…the single most important thing that you can do is improve how you start your day.”

Elrod experienced another setback during the 2008 recession. He lost his clients and his home. He was in financial jeopardy and depressed. A friend advised him to get up early and go jogging while listening to self-help audiobooks to get blood and oxygen flowing to the brain while allowing ideas to flow. Miraculously, this advice was so beneficial that it hauled Elrod out of his slump. He began looking forward to mornings instead of dreading them, and within just two months, his life started to improve. Newly invigorated, Elrod committed to spending time on personal development. He believed that dedicating a portion of his morning to self-development would set him up to win the day. He analyzed various experts and concluded that [six practices](https://youtu.be/U0uRp7BoPVY?t=3830) – “meditation, affirmations, visualization, exercise, reading and journaling” – can boost self-development. Elrod resolved to incorporate all six of these practices into his “miracle morning.” He began waking up earlier and accomplishing more each day.

    “It’s not what you do that matters nearly as much as who you become.”

To [change a habit](https://youtu.be/U0uRp7BoPVY?t=4440), stick with it for 30 days. The first 10 days are “unbearable.” Many people quit at this juncture because they don’t realize that change is difficult only at first. The second 10 days are “uncomfortable.” But by the final 10 days, you feel “unstoppable.” You wake up and realize you’re not dreading what you set out to do but looking forward to it. Challenge yourself for 30 days to wake up earlier, focus on your dreams and level up.
