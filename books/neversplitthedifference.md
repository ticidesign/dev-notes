Chris Voss’s book, [“Never Split the Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It”](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26156469-never-split-the-difference) calls on his FBI career as their top hostage negotiator to equip readers with the negotiating skills needed to secure business deals. It presents an alternative to Roger Fisher’s classic guidebook, [“Getting to Yes.”](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/313605.Getting_to_Yes) For author Chris Voss, the use of rational tools and techniques is not the most effective approach for negotiations. Instead, the key to success, especially in very dangerous negotiations, is tactical empathy, which he describes as “emotional intelligence on steroids.”

## Chapter 1: The New Rules
How to Become the Smartest Person… in Any Room

    Negotiators must be active listeners in order to gain the trust of the other party.

Negotiation begins with the simple premise that humans want to be accepted and understood. Choosing to be an active listener is the simplest, yet most effective concession we can make to get there. By being active listeners, we demonstrate empathy and show a sincere desire to better understand what the other side would possibly experience.
