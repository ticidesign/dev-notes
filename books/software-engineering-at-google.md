One key insight they share in this book is that software engineering can be thought of as “programming integrated over time.” What practices can we introduce to our code to make it _sustainable_ — able to react to necessary change — over its life cycle, from conception to introduction to maintenance to deprecation?

The book emphasizes three fundamental principles that they feel software organizations should keep in mind when designing, architecting, and writing their code:

**Time and Change**

- How code will need to adapt over the length of its life

**Scale and Growth**

- How an organization will need to adapt as it evolves

**Trade-offs and Costs**

- How an organization makes decisions, based on the lessons of Time and Change and Scale and Growth
