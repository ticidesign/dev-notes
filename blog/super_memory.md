ðŸ’¡ On the true potential of our brains...

"Thereâ€™s a great lie that weâ€™ve been lead about our brains, that somehow its potential is fixed. And what we know that is, 1/3 of your memory is pre-determined by genetics and your biology. But the exciting news is... two-thirds is completely in your control."

ðŸ“š On the big gap of our current education system...

"School teaches you what to learn â€” Math, history, science, spanish, important subjects â€” But how many classes are there about HOW to learn? HOW to think? HOW to solve problems? HOW to be creative? HOW to focus and concentrate?"

ðŸ”‘ On the most important skill you can master...

"If thereâ€™s ONE skill to master in the 21st century, itâ€™s your ability to learn fasterâ€¦ Because the world is happening so fast, the amount of information is doubling at dizzying speed.

"But how we learn it, how we read it, how we remember it, how we recall it â€” Hasnâ€™t changed very much."
