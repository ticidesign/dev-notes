Unleash Your Mind With The Silva Ultramind System

The Silva Ultramind System is a highly optimized framework for awakening your mind’s fullest potential. It is based on The Silva Method: a pioneering mind empowerment methodology founded in 1960 by Texan radio engineer Jose Silva, with over 6+ million students in 110 countries.

Through an easy-to-follow process, you gain an instinctive understanding of the four primary states of consciousness the human mind operates in - and how to use each one to perform, evolve, and live at your peak:

THE BETA LEVEL
Your default level of consciousness when you’re awake and alert.

THE ALPHA LEVEL
A calm and receptive state experienced during relaxation and light sleep. The optimal state for learning, growth, and self-awareness.

THE THETA LEVEL
The state of meditation and deep sleep. Enables enhanced introspection, self-hypnosis, mind-body healing, and more.

THE DELTA LEVEL
The deepest state of unconsciousness and dreamless sleep.

After decades of rigorous case studies and research, The Silva Method has found that the Alpha and Theta levels of consciousness play the biggest roles in a person’s self-evolution.

This observation is confirmed by countless peer-reviewed studies: including studies on indigenous communities that harness this ‘polyphasic’ understanding of consciousness to awaken abilities unknown to the average person.

The Silva Ultramind System gives you the tools to access these abilities at will - so using them to transform your life becomes as easy and natural as breathing.
