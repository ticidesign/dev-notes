It will be fast if I just rewrote it :(

__Primary Purpose:__
- Code is for communicating ideas with other people.

Code that you do not understand is code that you cannot trust.
Code that you cannot trust is code that you do not understand.

Why are we always optimizing for __writability__ instead of optimizing for __readability__?

As much as 70% of our time spent coding is actually spent __reading the code__.

Code must first be read before it can be written.

The only way to ensure your code survives is to make sure it's __readable__.

⚠️ If your code has to be rewritten to be fixed, imporved or extended, you failed. ⚠️ 

__Suggestions:__

- Take 6 minutes out of every hour to refactoring and make your code more readable.

    "My boss/client will never approve spending more time on readability."

Because of that 70% figure, shortcomings in readability compound more quickly over time. Every moment saved in readability compounds more quickly, too.

Documentation and tests are important, but ultimately they're __indirectly__ related to code quality.

Readability __directly__ impacts your ability, and that of everyone else, to do their job.

Readability isn't just a good idea or a nice-to-have, it's the __whole point__.

The one thing we will always be better at than the computer: empathetic communication with other people.

"Yeah, you’ll collect the paycheck. But make a difference and survive is if you communicate those ideas well, if your code is more readable. It’s not easy, but that’s the whole reason we have a profession. Cuz otherwise let’s just let the computer do it. Alright, thank you." Kyle Simpson
