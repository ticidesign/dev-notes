# Unconscious Bias

We're all biased. Our experiences shape who we are, and our race, ethnicity, gender, height, weight, sexual orientation, place of birth, and other factors impact the lens with which we view the world. In this course, diversity expert Stacey Gordon helps you recognize and acknowledge your own biases so that you can identify them when making decisions, and prevent yourself from making calls based on a biased viewpoint. Stacey explains some of the most common forms that a bias takes: affinity bias, halo bias, perception bias, and confirmation bias. She helps you recognize the negative effects of bias within your organization, as well as the benefits to be realized by uncovering bias in decision-making processes. Finally, she outlines strategies for overcoming personal and organizational bias.

Learning Objectives:
- Recognize when unconscious bias occurs and why it's important to understand.
- Explore how unconscious bias is relevant in the business worlds.
- Identify three strategies to counteract potential unconscious bias.
- Define confirmation bias.
- Review the meaning of the Halo Effect.
- Explore the effects groupthink can have in a professional setting.

## What is unconscious bias?

- bias that is automatically activated
- bias that affects our decision-making ability
- bias that affects how we think from day to day

Feedback

Unconscious bias refers to the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our views, our actions, and our decision-making ability.

## Can bias impact a company's expenses?

Yes. When employees see others being promoted based on relationship rather than merit, they leave the company.

Feedback

Correct! CareerBuilder estimates that turnover costs companies 22,000 per employee.

## How can physical attributes feed unconscious biases?

If someone has an attribute we find favorable, subconsciously we think that person is good, and of course we want to associate with good people.

Feedback

Yes. It's this unconscious need to categorize people that leads to the kinds of decisions that favor some and leave others out in the cold.

## Affinity bias

Affinity bias is the tendency to warm up to people like ourselves.

How can Group Think or the Bandwagon Effect affect your company?

Group Think can stifle creativity and independent thought.

Feedback

Yes! Because groupthink occurs when individuals try too hard to fit into a group, by agreeing with the majority, or by stifling opinions that may differ from the group, people are willing to go along to get along.

What can we do to tackle underlying unconscious bias?

- Resolve to do something and hold yourself accountable.
- Ensure that there is widespread awareness of the unconscious bias.
- Acknowledge that the problem exists.

Feedback

Tackling the underlying unconscious bias can be achieved by acknowledging the problem exists, ensuring there is widespread awareness of it, resolving to do something about it, and becoming accountable for your actions.

How can you structure your decision making process so that it is fair?

By creating standardized processes.

Feedback

Yes. Creating standard processes will help you to pause before you react in favor of, or to the detriment of someone in a review process.

What's next

By this point in the course, we've learned what bias is, that we're all biased, and a few examples of unconscious bias. So, what do we do with all of this new found information? Project Implicit was developed by a consortium of researchers from Harvard University, the University of Virginia, and the University of Washington. The Implicit Association Test, or IAT, is one of the most popular and well-known tools to assess individual bias. Introduced in 1998, the IAT was developed as part of a project to detect implicit, on unconscious bias based on several factors including race, gender, sexual orientation, and national origin. Measuring attitudes and beliefs that you may be reluctant or unable to detect, is a first step toward changing and acknowledging bias and possibly changing your behavior. The IAT has been used by millions of people around the world and I suggest you visit the website and take a test. There are more than a dozen so don't get overwhelmed. I recommend you begin with one or two because after acknowledging the bias, you'll want to do something about it. If you would like to learn more, there are other resources on this site. 

My course on diversity recruiting addresses the difficulty in sourcing great hires. And my course on resumes provides an in-depth practical guide for creating or revising your resume. As a diversity professional with recruiting expertise, my goal is to help candidates choose a job they will love while helping companies become their employer of choice. If you fall into either category, or if you are interested in contributing feedback to help address unconscious bias, I invite you to stay in touch with me through my website and on LinkedIn. I hope you enjoyed this course and found value in it. Tackling unconscious bias and diversity issues doesn't have to be difficult and together I know we can change more lives and careers for the better.
