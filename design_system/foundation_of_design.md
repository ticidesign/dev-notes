# Foundations of Design

Notes from [Emma Bostian course](https://fem-design-systems.netlify.app/color) 

## Color

Color is one of the most important foundational elements of a design system and impacts every single component.

Color theory is the combination of art and science that's used to determine how colors interact.

**Color Mixing**

There are two methods for producing colors: additive and subtractive.

**Color types**
- Primary Colors: red, yellow, and blue.
- Secondary Colors: purple, orange, and green.
- Tertiary Colors: red-orange, yellow-orange, yellow-green, blue-green, blue-violet, and red-violet.

**Color palettes**
- Monochromatic
- Complementary
- Analogous
- Triadic

**Color terminology**
- Hue
- Saturation
- Luminance
- Shade
- Tint
- Tone

[**Color semantics**](https://fem-design-systems.netlify.app/color-semantics)

**Color values**
- HEX
- RGB
- RGBA
- CYMK

Dinamic generate color pallets using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)

## Typography

**Ascender**

The piece of a letter which rises above the x-height.

**Descender**

The piece of a letter which dips below the baseline.

**Baseline**

The imaginary line on which most letter characters sit.

**Cap Line**

The imaginary line that marks the upper boundary of capital letters and some lowercase letters' ascenders.

**X-Height**

Height of the typeface's lowercase letters.

**Tracking / Letter Spacing**

The uniform amounts of spacing between characters in a complete section of text.

**Kerning**

The horizontal spacing between two consecutive characters.

**Leading**

The vertical spacing between lines of text (from baseline to baseline).

### Font types

There are several different types of fonts and each has distinguishing characteristics.

Serif, Sans-Serif, Monospaced

### Font measurements

**Pixels**

The units used by designers, however they shouldn't be used to define a type scale.

**Em**

The unit of typography equal to the currently specified point-size. 1em can compute to different values depending upon where you are in the code.

**Rem**

The unit of typography equal to the root font size. 1 rem will be equal to the font size defined in the html element.

### Typescale

There are several scales to choose from when building an application. Here are some of the most popular.

- Major Third
- Major Second
- Perfect Fourth
- Golden Ratio
- Perfect Fifth

### Other areas of design

There are several other areas of design which we won't touch on today, but would be included in a fully-built design system.

Some of these areas include:

Grid
Spacing
Accessibility
Motion
Iconography
