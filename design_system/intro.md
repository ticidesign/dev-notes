# Intro

“If a design system is by a company, then it’s for the company. It might also be open source, but any ol’ random developer who wants to use it isn’t the target audience.” - Chris Coyier

## Why do design systems matter?

1. Accessibility
Everyone, regardless of circumstance, should be able to achieve the same results from your application.

2. Consistence
Your products should look and feel like they're part of the same brand identity.

3. Trickle-down updates
The style can be updated in one component within the system, and will propagate to each product.

4. Responsiveness
Our web aspplications must account fro different screen resolutions and devices

5. Onboarding
There is one place for new team members to go to get all the information they need to get started

6. Flexibility
A desxign sustem must serve a variety of use cases, while setting parameters on what exactly those use cases can be.

7. Speed
Once your design system has been established, time to production is greatly reduced.

## Drawbacks

1. Time
Design system take time to build

2. Evolution
A design system is never complete. It's a product serving products.

3. Maintenance
A design system is a living, breathing product which has lifecycles and requires maintenance.

4. Investment
We need designer, engineers and product managers to ensure the sucess of the system.

## Three pillars of design systems

1. Design language
The set of standards ans assets which guide the creation of a suit of products underneath a brand. The personality of a brand and its corresponding design assets.

2. Component library
Set of components which turn the design language and UI kit into living, breathing code. Can be built with many different frameworks and libraries. (ex: react, CSS-in-JS, etc)

3. Style guide
The documentation for the design language, UI kit and component library. (ex: storybook, invision, gatsby or react styleguidist)
