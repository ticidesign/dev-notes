# Spring Data

What is it? Spring Data is a collection of data-access projects that share common programming model.

Why?

- It’s a wrapper around the data access library always making use of the same common interfaces abstractions
- Convention over configurations

Abstractions

- CRUD
- Derived queries (it will generate queries based on the names of methods)
- Transactions management (declarations reducing boilerplate)
- Pagination and Sorting
- Auditing
- more…

Benefits

- Consistent programming model
    - same abstractions for all modules
    - rarely touch underlying libraries
    - easy to learn additional modules
- Reduces boilerplate
- Integrates easily with [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
