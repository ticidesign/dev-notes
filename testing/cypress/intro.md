# End to end testing with Cypress

https://egghead.io/courses/end-to-end-testing-with-cypress

The tools available for unit testing have come a long way. While testing may never be “easy”, the available tools have certainly moved testing closer to the simple end of the spectrum. Full end to end testing hasn’t quite kept the same pace and as a result many applications are testing manually and often by users in production. Cypress provides a testing environment that makes end-to-end testing fast and reliable with a simple API that makes creating automated unit tests for your web applications a no-brainer.

Testing applications in a real browser is incredibly valuable.

Historically, the tools available to automate these tests have left a bit to be desired. Those tests control the browser as a black box and as our applications get more complex, it gets harder to keep those tests from becoming flaky.

We often end up doing time consuming and costly manual testing.

In this course we'll see how Cypress is changing all of that.

Cypress allows us to create relaible, flake-free tests that run in a real browser with a powerful UI that makes easy work of debugging. Our tests are written in a straightforward JavaScript API built on tool that may already be familiar, like Mocha and Chai.

This course will teach you how to create reliable tests for your application without the pain that traditionally comes with UI testing.
