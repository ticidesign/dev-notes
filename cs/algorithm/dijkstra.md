#Dijkstra's algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm <-- the algorithm to use when you have negative weights

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm <-- an example of a greedy algorithm, which finds the “minimum spanning tree”, which is closely related to the shortest path.

A practical use case of one of these algos is the “flood fill” algorithm which is related to the shortest path algorithm and that we happened to use on the Enlitic project for detecting the size of a lung nodule. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill
