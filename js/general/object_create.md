## The Object create() method

Introduced in ES5. Creates a new object, with the specified prototype. Returns a new object with the specified prototype object and properties.

 `Object.create` is going to give us fine-grained control over our object later on.

Syntax:
```js
Object.create(proto, [propertiesObject])
```

Usage:
```js
const newObject = Object.create(prototype)
```

Example:
```js
const animal = {}
const dog = Object.create(animal)
```
The newly create object will inherit all the prototyope object properties.

You can specify a second parameter to add new properties to the object, that the prototype lacked:
```js
const newObject = Object.create(prototype, newProperties)
```
where newProperties is an object of objects that define each property.

Example:
```js
const animal = {}
const dog = Object.create(animal, {
  breed: {
    value: 'Siberian Husky'
  }
});
console.log(dog.breed) //'Siberian Husky'
```
I didnâ€™t just say `breed: 'Siberian Husky'` but I had to pass a property descriptor object, defined at the beginning of this page.

`Object.create()` is often used in combination with `Object.assign()`:
 
```js
const dog = Object.assign(Object.create(animal), {
  bark() {
    console.log('bark')
  }
})
```
