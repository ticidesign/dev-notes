# Async

Asynchronicity is the backbone of modern web development in JavaScript yet...

JavaScript is:
- Single threaded (one command runs at a time)
- Synchronously executed (each line is run in order the code appears)

So what if we have a task:
- Accessing Twitter’s server to get new tweets that takes a long time
- Code we want to run using those tweets

Challenge: We want to wait for the tweets to be stored in tweets so that they’re there
to run displayTweets on - but no code can run in the meantime

Slow function blocks further code running
```js
const tweets = getTweets("https://twitter.com/ticidesign/1")
// ⛔350ms wait while a request is sent to Twitter HQ
displayTweets(tweets)
// more code to run
console.log("I want to runnnn!")
```

What if we try to delay a function directly using setTimeout?
setTimeout is a built in function - its first argument is the function to delay followed by ms to delay by
```js
function printHello(){
 console.log("Hello");
}
setTimeout(printHello,1000);
console.log("Me first!");
```
In what order will our console logs appear?

So what about a delay of 0ms
Now, in what order will our console logs occur?
```js
function printHello(){
 console.log("Hello");
}
setTimeout(printHello,0);
console.log("Me first!");
```

JavaScript is not enough - We need new pieces (some of which aren’t JavaScript at all)

Our core JavaScript engine has 3 main parts:
- Thread of execution
- Memory/variable environment
- Call stack

We need to add some new components:
- Web Browser APIs/Node background APIs
- Promises
- Event loop, Callback/Task queue and micro task queue 

ES5 solution: Introducing ‘callback functions’, and Web Browser APIs
```js
function printHello(){ console.log("Hello"); }

setTimeout(printHello,1000);

console.log("Me first!");
```

We’re interacting with a world outside of JavaScript now - so we need rules

```js
function printHello(){ console.log("Hello"); }
function blockFor1Sec(){ 
    //blocks in the JavaScript thread for 1 sec
}

setTimeout(printHello,0);
blockFor1Sec()

console.log("Me first!");
```

ES5 Web Browser APIs with callback functions

Problems
- Our response data is only available in the callback function - Callback hell
- Maybe it feels a little odd to think of passing a function into another function only for it
to run much later

Benefits
- Super explicit once you understand how it works under-the-hood
