# "Zoom fatigue" and their simple fixes

This blog post is based on Bartek Pucek summary of [Stanford University research](eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-02/su-sri022221.php).

    Even as more people are logging onto popular video chat platforms to connect with colleagues, family and friends during the COVID-19 pandemic, Stanford researchers have a warning for you: Those video calls are likely tiring you out.

This one you probably already know without any research. But let’s look deeper at the 4 main reasons of "Zoom fatigue".

Zoom fatigue - a feeling of being mentally drained as a result of spending too much time on web conference calls

## Close-up eye contact is fatiguing

    Excessive amounts of close-up eye contact is highly intense. Both the amount of eye contact we engage in on video chats, as well as the size of faces on screens is unnatural.

**Proposed solution:**

Until the platforms change their interface, it is recommended to disable Zoom from the full-screen option and reduce the size of the Zoom window relative to the monitor to minimize face size, as well as use an external keyboard to allow for increased personal space between the monitor.

## Seeing yourself during video chats constantly in real-time is fatiguing

    Most video platforms show a square of what you look like on camera during a chat. But that’s unnatural, (communication Professor) Jeremy Bailenson said. ”In the real world, if somebody was following you around with a mirror constantly – so that while you were talking to people, making decisions, giving feedback, getting feedback – you were seeing yourself in a mirror, that would just be crazy. No one would ever consider that,” he added.

**Proposed solution:**

Use "Hide Self View" (available on Zoom).

## Reduced mobility is fatiguing

    Video chats dramatically reduce our usual mobility. In-person and audio phone conversations allow humans to walk around and move. But with videoconferencing, most cameras have a set field of view, meaning a person has to generally stay in the same spot. Movement is limited in ways that are not natural. “There’s a growing research now that says when people are moving, they’re performing better cognitively,” Bailenson said.

**Proposed solution:**

Think about your video conference space - where You have a camera placed, and if things like an external keyboard or standing desk can help you with reaching more space between You and zoom faces.

## Cognitive load is fatiguing

    The cognitive load is much higher in video chats. Bailenson notes that in regular face-to-face interaction, nonverbal communication is quite natural and each of us naturally makes and interprets gestures and nonverbal cues subconsciously. But in video chats, we have to work harder to send and receive signals.

**Proposed solution:**

During long meetings, you should take a break "just for the sound". It's not just turning off the camera to take a break from having to be non-verbally active, but also turning your body away from the screen and the gestures of other participants we're overstimulating with.
