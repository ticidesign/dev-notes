Some details on how ⚡️instant calls⚡️ work:
- You can click on someone and talk immediately, but they will be on mute until they accept.
- All calls start as voice, but can be upgraded to video and screenshare.
- Customizable rooms are a nice way to invite teammates to talk when they're free.
Some details on app presence:
- Your teammates will be able to see which work app you're currently in (only for a select set of integrated apps) - this gives everyone a sense of being together, and helps you know when a teammate is interruptible. 
- You can go into Focus Mode if you don't want to be bothered, in which case your app will not be shown.
